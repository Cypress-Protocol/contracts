## Introduction
Welcome to the Cypress App Smart Contracts repository. This README provides information on the Solidity smart contracts that power the on-chain component of the Cypress app. These contracts are responsible for managing user rewards, sustainability tracking, and other blockchain-related functionalities.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following prerequisites:

- **Solidity**: Familiarity with the Solidity programming language.
- **Ethereum-Compatible Blockchain**: A development environment or testnet supporting Ethereum-compatible smart contracts for deployment and testing.

## Project Overview
The Cypress App Smart Contracts facilitate various functionalities, including but not limited to:
- Managing user accounts and rewards.
- Recording sustainable transportation transactions.
- Handling gas fee sponsorship by partnered companies.

## Smart Contracts
- `UserRewards.sol`: Manages user rewards and garden-related data.
- `SustainableTransport.sol`: Records sustainable transportation transactions.
- `GasSponsorship.sol`: Handles gas fee sponsorship by partnered companies.

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Change your directory to the project folder.

   ```bash
   cd cypress-app-smart-contracts
   ```

3. Install the required Solidity development tools and dependencies.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Deployment
1. Configure your development environment for deploying Solidity smart contracts to your chosen blockchain network or testnet.

2. Compile the smart contracts using your preferred Solidity development tool (e.g., Truffle).

3. Deploy the compiled smart contracts to the blockchain network.

## Project Structure
- `contracts/`: Contains the Solidity smart contract files.
- `migrations/`: Migration scripts for deploying contracts.
- `test/`: Testing scripts for verifying contract functionality.
- `truffle-config.js`: Truffle configuration file for deployment settings.

## Tech Stack
- **Solidity**: The primary language for writing smart contracts.
- **Truffle**: Development and deployment framework for Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Ganache**: A local blockchain for development and testing.
- **Web3.js / Ethers.js**: JavaScript library for interacting with Ethereum-compatible blockchains.
- **Remix**: Online smart contract testing

## Testing
To ensure the reliability and security of the smart contracts, thorough testing is essential. Use tools like Truffle and Ganache for running unit tests on the contracts.
